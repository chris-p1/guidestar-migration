# What is this?

This is a script to help convert the old firebase format for the older Guidestar plugin to the new format of the newer Guidestar plugin. The intent is to run this only once after the migration of the old plugin is complete.

# Usage

This will only ever be run once. I only checked this repo in for future reference in case we need to do something similar down the line.

To run:

```sh
go run main.go
```
